# Comparative effectiveness of 6x R-CHOP21 versus 6x R-CHOP21 + 2R for patients with advanced-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

First-line treatment for advanced-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) typically involves 6x R-CHOP21 or 6x R-CHOP21 with two additional rituximab administrations (6x R-CHOP21 + 2 R). In contemporary practice, this treatment choice might be guided by interim PET scan results. This nationwide, population-based study investigates the comparative effectiveness of these treatment regimens in an era where interim PET-guided treatment decisions were not standard practice. Utilizing the Netherlands Cancer Registry, we identified 1577 adult patients diagnosed with advanced-stage DLBCL between 2014-2018 who completed either 6x R-CHOP21 (43%) or 6x R-CHOP21 + 2 R (57%). We used propensity scores to assess differences in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). At five years, EFS (hazard ratio of 6x R-CHOP21 + 2 R versus 6x R-CHOP21 [HR] = 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.09) and OS (HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.18) were not significantly different between both regimens. In exploratory risk-stratified analysis according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI), high-IPI patients (i.e., scores of 4-5) benefit most from 6x R-CHOP21 + 2 R (5-year absolute risk difference of EFS = 16.8%; 95% CI, -0.4%-34.1% and OS = 12.1%; 95% CI, -5.4-29.6%). Collectively, this analysis reveals no significant differences on average in EFS and OS between the two treatments. However, the potential benefits for high-risk patients treated with 6x R-CHOP21 + 2 R underscore the need for future research.
